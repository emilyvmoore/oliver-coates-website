These piano pieces were written in the last few years for McCarthy. After her massive success composing the soundtrack to <i>Under the Skin</i>, Levi’s relationship with notated music and simple, elegant, repeating forms has reached a whole new audience. These pieces have also been interpreted on Moog synthesizer, but here we hear the full suite on solo piano with extra movements for this festival. Parallel harmonies move up and down the keyboard, full of colourful, dancing patterns, concise and emotionally direct.

Original performance on ARP 2500 modular synthesizer </br>recorded by Éliane Radigue</br></br>

<i>Jetsun Mila</i> is inspired by the life of Milarepa, a great yogi and poet of Tibet from the 11th century. The story of his life as told to his closest disciple, Rechungpa, represents one of the most famous works in Tibetan culture. The <i>Mila Kabum</i>, or <i>Namthar</i>, has been translated into several Western languages, including English and French. In this story of Milarepa’s life, we can see how in one lifetime one can accomplish amazing deeds through ascetic practices and spiritual endeavors. Radigue’s 84-minute musical evocation of Milarepa’s life is in nine sections, with prelude, which correspond to major periods of the </br>life of Milarepa.              </br>

Andrew Hamilton: <i>O.A.I.R</i> (2013; 30’)</br></br>Eliza McCarthy, piano</br></br>This piece was inspired by the choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker – a performance by her at Tate Modern in 2013 clarified Hamilton’s intentions for this hypnotic work. The glorious, larger-than-life ending was the first part of the piece to be written, and all preceding sounds are derived from it. “Only action is refined, talk is murky and dark, as unclean as hell itself” is a quote from Swiss writer Robert Walser. The piece looks to emulate Keersmaeker’s unflinching focus on small amounts of material in a constant state </br>of transformation.               </br>

Galina Ustvolskaya: <i>Sonata for violin & piano</i> (1952; 21’) </br>J.S. Bach: <i>Chaconne</i> from <i>Partita No.2 in D minor, BWV.1004</i></br> (1717-20; 10’) </br>
Galina Ustvolskaya: <i>Duet for violin & piano</i> (1964; 24’) </br></br>Patricia Kopatchinskaja, violin</br>Markus Hinterhäuser, piano</br></br>The Bach <i>Chaconne</i> for solo violin is a monumental set of variations upon a repeating bassline. It is composed against a strong, repeating foundation which evolves and flowers as one of the most profound works of Western classical music. Everything relates to the awareness of one repeating figure. Ustvolskaya is one of the most singular voices to emerge from Soviet Russia. She believed “the best method of talking about music is to be silent about it”. She is often mentioned in relation to Shostakovich, but refuted any connection with him until her late years: “On my part I would like to say the following: never once during the years, even during my studies at the Conservatory which </br>I spent in his class, was Shostakovich’s music close to me. Nor was his personality.” The towering achievement of her music is its unremitting beauty, sparse clarity and intensity of ideas, repeated unapologetically so the listener can develop an immediate relationship with its materials – a direct correlation between sound and emotion.              </br>

Pauline Oliveros: <i>The Mystery Beyond Matter</i> (2014; 60’) </br>– UK premiere</br></br>Quiet Music Ensemble</br></br>Oliveros’ radiant <i>The Mystery Beyond Matter</i> was written specifically for Quiet Music Ensemble and explores a maze of acoustics created with specially developed software. It is an expanse of beautiful sonority, the sounds of each instrumentalist being processed through a special diffusion system. </br>“Since Quiet Music Ensemble likes to play long pieces, I decided to make a piece with no beginning and no end. This way they could play until their hearts were content. There is an ever changing drone that at least one player keeps going. The drone is played in a simulated reverberant space. The timbre of the drone is always evolving. The drone may be anything from a single tone to noise of wide spectrum – always quiet, always making shapes. Other players enter solos over the drone, sometimes alone, sometimes overlapping one another. The mystery is how and when to begin and to end.”—Pauline Oliveros               </br>

Jennifer Walshe: <i>Dordán</i> (2013; 30’)</br></br>Quiet Music Ensemble</br></br><i>Dordán</i> draws on the work of Irish outsider artists Pádraig Mac </br>Giolla Mhuire and Caoimhín Breathnach, both of whom are alter egos of Walshe. </br>In 2009, Irish musicologist Antoinne Ó Murchú was digging through the archives of the Irish Folklore Commission when he came across a set of bizarre recordings made in Cork in 1952. The only information noted on the tapes was “Pádraig Mac Giolla Mhuire”. As Ó Murchú listened to the recordings, he immediately recognised them as a precursor of late 20th-century minimalism. He recalls, “I was shocked and immensely excited…layers of grinding drones from the fiddle and accordion with a tin whistle whirling above like some demented Eric Dolphy solo…to think that the roots of minimalism could lie in Irish outsider culture…”</br>Ó Murchú discovered that Pádraig was born in New York in 1923, the son of Michael and Maggie, who had immigrated there from Cork. After Michael’s death from tuberculosis in 1950, Maggie and Pádraig returned to Ireland. Back in Cork, Pádraig began playing with local musicians, developing a style he called “dordán”, after the Irish word for drones. Ó Cinnéide, one of Pádraig’s musical collaborators from this time, has described how “he was a soft, kind lad with a strange ear…he wanted to get rid of everything except for the held notes of </br>the pipes…no tunes, no chanter, just the drones…truth to tell, it was </br>a very quare sound…”</br>Caoimhín Breathnach lived in Knockvicar, Co. Roscommon, as a recluse for most of his life. Upon his death in 2009, a huge archive, including diaries, drawings, photographs and tapes, was found in his cottage. The main focus of Caoimhín’s artistic practice was the creation of “subliminal tapes”. His techniques involved recording sounds onto cassettes, then subjecting them to a wide range of physical processes, such as burying, burning or encasing them in various materials such as velvet, paper or moss. He believed the tapes could heal and enable listeners to access other dimensions.</br>—Jennifer Walshe </br></br>	      <b>10.10pm: Ends</b>

Laurie Spiegel: <i>Return to Zero</i> (1970; 20’) – European premiere </br>Laurie Spiegel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx68Y_OBpHA"><i>Passage</i></a> (1990; 13’) – European premiere </br>Aura Satz: <i>Little doorways to paths not yet taken</i></br> (short film; 2016; 7’) – world premiere</br>Laurie Spiegel: <i>A Harmonic Algorithm 2011</i></br> (2011; 20’) – European concert premiere </br></br>Sound Intermedia, sound diffusion</br></br><i>Return to Zero</i> has been digitised from decaying magnetic tape especially for this festival. It was made entirely on a Moog modular synthesizer. <i>Passage</i> was made using sounds from a Yamaha TX816 synthesizer with a compositional algorithm programmed by Spiegel on a Mac SE. The pitch content of <i>A Harmonic Algorithm 2011</i> was generated by a Mac SE running C language software written by Spiegel, outputting MIDI notes to a MacBook Pro, which provided the orchestration and recorded the resultant audio to its hard drive.</br>In the early 1970s, Spiegel, Éliane Radigue and Rhys Chatham shared the same studio. They began to talk of a desire to develop something they called Slow Change Music: “We wanted to make barely perceptible changes within a relatively stable sound or sonic complex. We wanted the changes to be subtle so that our mind’s ear’s filters would open and lift, to reassure with constancy so that any sense of being sonically on guard against sudden change would fade away and we could be in the experience of the moment. You want to get beyond all the little tricks the mind has learned to avoid the shocks of sudden change or the stress of overload, to be without the preconceptions and defenses we put between us and what we are hearing.”—Laurie Spiegel </br><i>A Harmonic Algorithm 2011</i> can be explained as a hybrid of J.S. Bach and Spiegel. It began with an idea about biology and code: “If instead of composing individual, finite length works, a composer could encode in computer software their personal compositional methods, preferences, processes and ways of making musical decisions, and somehow their aesthetic sensibility too, then they could go on composing and generating new music long after the biological human had ceased to exist. New music could continue to appear that would be uniquely that composer’s. But of course it turns out that the composer writing the algorithm is a strong factor in the mix, so this piece turns out to be a merging of Bach and Spiegel’s musical selves. I hope you’ll be able to hear that true blend that is what this musical work must inevitably be. In figuring out this particular logic, I spent a lot of time studying the harmonic progressions in Bach’s <i>Chorales</i>, on which I based this software.”—Laurie Spiegel

Éliane Radigue: <i>OCCAM I</i> (2011; 30’) </br></br>Rhodri Davies, bowed harp</br></br>“A sound gently emerges and when its presence is felt another appears as if from nowhere. The two sounds crossfade into each other and as the two territories intermingle they produce a multiplicity of partials and sub-harmonics. The first sound then slowly disappears and thus the journey continues. Often one only becomes aware of a change after it has happened. Time has elongated and also compacted. The music exists in time yet it possesses numerous times all at once. Serendipitously, our last day of work on <i>OCCAM I</i> fell on Éliane’s 79th birthday in January 2011.”—Rhodri Davies</br>“The freedom to be immersed in the ambivalence of continuous modulation with the uncertainty of being and/or not being in this or that mode or tonality. The freedom to let yourself be overwhelmed, submerged in a continuous sound flow where perceptual acuity is heightened through the discovery of a certain slight beating, there in the background, pulsations, breath.”—Éliane Radigue              </br>

Our perspective on the music is altered: what we hear is simultaneously both in the room and seemingly elsewhere.

“MMM: Lullaby to Dawn”</br>Pauline Oliveros: <i>Lullaby for Daisy Pauline</i> (1980; 12’) </br>Pauline Oliveros: <i>Tuning Meditation</i> </br>Meredith Monk: <i>Quarry Weave 1</i> (1976; 5’) – European premiere </br>Meredith Monk Music ASCAP</br>Meredith Monk: <i>Afternoon Melodies</i> (1988; 5’) – European premiere </br>Meredith Monk: <i>Dawn</i> (1985; 5’) </br></br>Vocal Constructivists </br>Jane Alden, Alison Cross, Rebecca Hardwick, </br>Jessica Loeb, Delea Shand, sopranos</br>Barbara Alden, Gina Fergione, Rachel Hewitt, </br>Celia Springate, Ali Warner, altos</br>George Chambers, Simon Walton, Ben Zucker, tenors</br>Aubrey Botsford, John Hails, Peter Johnson, David Till, basses</br>Lauren Redhead, organ</br></br><i>Lullaby for Daisy Pauline</i> reflects Oliveros’ interest in tuning, specifically musicians tuning to one another. Her instructions include, “Hum the sound of pleasure as if you were serenading your best loved infant…play with the MMM sound by adding vowels and diphthongs between the Ms using any repetitions or prolongations…stay open to your own sensations and imagine gradually expanding your awareness to sensing your surroundings.” The work is presented in the form of a circle, relating to Oliveros’ interest in mandalas.</br><i>Quarry Weave 1</i> comes from Monk’s 1976 opera <i>Quarry</i>, in which a sick child (played by Monk) has feverish hallucinations about the ills of the world. Monk writes, “I read <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i> from cover to cover and looked at photographs in the war museum in the Marais area of Paris and talked to a man who’d come from Buchenwald – Henri Michel…I had to confront those photographs straight on.” The child lies on a blanket in the centre of the performance space while her dreams appear: a cloud dance and a Fascist rally transform the space into a concentration camp; a biblical couple visit, disappear and reappear as Holocaust-era Chassids. Monk explains, “I used Jew as a metaphor. I was trying to get the four corners of the world…different people existing simultaneously before </br>a catastrophe.”</br><i>Afternoon Melodies</i> is a collection of four monodic vocal solos which comes from Monk’s 1988 film <i>Book of Days</i>, which tells the story of a 14th-century Jewish girl called Eva who is troubled by disturbing visions of the future – images that are placed in the context of the Black Plague and religious persecution, but include visions of </br>New York in the 20th century and the AIDS crisis. </br><i>Dawn</i> is also drawn from <i>Book of Days</i>. The title refers to an experience Monk shared in 1978: “I was on top of Mount Sinai as the sun came up, and as it rose I saw one Bedouin man sitting on the top of the next mountain, just watching the sunrise. It really was like seeing the beginning of the world, the rays of light, the blossoming of every day.” In Monk’s hands, time is not just a measuring device, but a map of our lives: “I’m trying to leave a lot of space, so people can </br>hook in, in their own way.”</br></br>
